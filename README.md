# 1. About the project

The idea of this project is to create an application for etracting metadata about movies. The metadata is extracted from the website [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com), where one can find basic information about a movie, ratings, comments, recommendations etc.
Metadata is inserted in site's webpages in a structured format using [Microdata standard](http://dev.w3.org/html5/md/), specifically using [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) vocabulary. After the metadata is extracted, it is transformed to RDF format and stored into RDF repository. Access to the extracted data is enabled through RESTful services.

Application workflow consists of the following phases
- A web crawler parses movie webpages from [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com) website and extracts movie metada
- Extracted data is transformed into RDF triplets based on [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) vocabulary
- Data is persisted into an RDF repository
- Access to the data is enabled through RESTful services

# 2. Domain model

Webpages of movies from the [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com) website are analyzed in order to determine which classes and properties form the [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) vocabulary are supported. Based on that analysis, domain model is created and it is depicted in Picture 1.

Picture 1 - Domain model

Class *Movie* contains basic information about a movie, such as: movie title. description, release date, url of the movie's image, genres and awards. Also, it has references to its actors and director (class Person), its current rating (class AggregateRating) and its production company (class Organization).

Class *Person* contains basic information ofa person, such as person's name, image, url address and short description about that person.

Class *AggregateRating* contains information about a movie rating which is calculated based on visitors' votes and comments. It hold information about the best and worst rating values, review count, current rating value and the name of the aggregate rating method.

Class *Organization* contains name of the production company.

# 3. The solution

This application collects metadata about movies from the webpage [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com). The data is extracted by the crawler and is used to create domain objects of the application that are persisted into an RDF repository. The application allows access to that data via RESTful services.

The applications contains two REST services.

* **GET /api/ movies** - returns data about all movies. Service's parameters are:

* *limit* - number of results
* *offset* - starting position of the results
* *minReleaseYear* - minimum value of the release year 
* *maxReleaseYear* - maximum value of the release year
* *actors* - name(s) of the actors that played in the movie. Multiple actor names can be supplied, which are in that case coma separated
* *minRatingValue* - minimum rating value
* *maxRatingValue* - maximum rating value
* *productionCompany* - name of the production company
* *genres* - genres of the movie. Multiple genre names can be supplied, which are in that case coma separated
* *directedBy* - name of the movie director
* *minReviewCount* - minimum review count value
* *hasAwards* - filters out only movies that are awarder with any award. Possible values are true or false

An example of a service call:
> GET / movies?minRevireCount=10&genres=Drama,Comedy&minReleaseYear=2012&productionCompany=ParamountPictures

* **GET/movies/id** - returns data about the movie with specified id

An example of a service call:
> GET/movies/3d548b4f-07e6-4e7f-8ebc-770b8801f5a6

# 4. Technical realisation

This application is written in programming language Java. 

[Jsoup library](http://jsoup.org/) is used for analyzing and collecting data from the web pages. It provides a very convenient API for extracting and manipulating data, using the best of DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods.

this application also uses [Jenabean library](https://code.google.com/p/jenabean/) for mapping Java objects into RDF triplets using annotations. Jenabean provides explicit binding between an object property and a particular RDF property.

[Jena TDB](http://jena.apache.org/documentation/tdb/) library is used for data storage in the RDF repository. TDB is a component of Jena for RDF storage and query. It support the full range of Jena APIs.

Implementation of the RESTful web service is supported by [Jersey](https://jersey.java.net/) framework. Jersey is the open source JAX-RS Reference Implementation for building RESTful Web services. It uses annotations which define type of the HTTP requests (GET, POST ...) and also the path to the requested resource.
